# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of the project is to provide insight to PyBer, a ride-sharing company, regarding their performance in three different regions they conduct business; Rural, Suburban, and Urban. Analyze their market share based on the number of drivers, rides that took place, and fares collected in all three regions.
