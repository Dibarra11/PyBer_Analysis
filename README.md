# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of the project is to provide insight to PyBer, a ride-sharing company, regarding their performance in three different regions they conduct business; Rural, Suburban, and Urban. In addition, analyze their market share based on the number of drivers, rides that took place, fares collected, and average price in all three regions.

## Results

The following data was collected from the three regions based on Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fare, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver.

### Total Rides 

Urban cities have the highest number of rides, with 1,625, compared to suburban with 625 rides, and rural with 125 rides. So in perspective, urban cities have 1500 more rides than rural and 1000 more rides than Suburban.

### Total Drivers

Given the number of Rides per region, we can infer that Urban cities have more drivers, with 2405, followed by Suburban with 490 and Rural with 78.

### Total Fare & Average Fare per Ride

Rural cities had the highest average fare per ride at $34.62, Suburban at $30.90, and Urban at $ 24.53. We can see a higher fare in rural areas associated with fewer drivers, creating a higher demand for riders. Consequently, we see the same trend for Suburban. On the other hand, urban cities had the lowest average price due to the high volume of drivers in the area, making the ride-sharing commodity widely available.

### Average Fare per Driver

Rural cities ranked with the highest Average fare per driver at $55.49, Suburban at $39.50, and Urban at $16.57. We can see the same trend in Total Fare & Average Fare per Rider, given the higher number of drivers in the region will drive an average lower to those compared to having fewer drivers.

## Summary 

The following recommendations are to be considered to improve ride-sharing services and  generate more profit for PyBer.

First, recommendations lower the number of drivers in Urban cities to create more demand for riders. This will generate a higher average fare per rider and driver.

Second recommendation Rural cities produce higher averages in fare per rider and driver with the least amount of drivers per region. Slightly increase the number of drivers in rural cities.

The third recommendation is that suburban areas are performing exceptionally well, maintain the current plan.
